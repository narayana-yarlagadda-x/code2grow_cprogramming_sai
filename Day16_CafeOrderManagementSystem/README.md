Today day 16 of challenge 
The programm about cafe order Management ssystem 
It starts by storing prices and names of 5 menu items (Coffee, Tea, Sandwich, Burger, and Pastry) along with an array to track how many of each are sold.
It then displays a menu with item numbers, names, and prices.
The program asks how many customers there are (up to 10).
For each customer, it asks how many different items they want to order, then takes input for each item number and quantity. 
It checks if the input is valid (item number between 1 and 5 and quantity positive).
For valid entries, it calculates the bill for that customer by multiplying the price and quantity, adds it to the total revenue, and updates how many of that item were sold. 
After all customers are processed, it calculates which item was sold the most and which the least.
Finally, it displays the total revenue, total number of items sold, the most ordered item, and the least ordered item.
